# 📦 CDNMate - High-Performance Image Processing & CDN Uploader for Go

CDNMate is a blazing-fast, minimal-dependency image processing and CDN uploader package for Go. Designed for **high performance and efficiency**, CDNMate **resizes, cleanses, and uploads images** with ease—without relying on external libraries.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Lightweight & Fast** – Optimized image processing with pure Go.  
✅ **Automatic Resizing** – Shrinks images to **99% of original size** for better CDN performance.  
✅ **Secure Processing** – Cleanses potential embedded scripts (like Laravel's image handling).  
✅ **Unique Filenames** – Prevents duplicate file uploads with auto-renaming.  
✅ **CDN Integration** – Seamless upload via HTTP PUT to any CDN or custom storage.  
✅ **Configurable** – Easily set paths and CDN endpoints via environment variables.

// Initialize Image Processor
processor := cdnmate.NewImageProcessor(envConfig)
```

### 2️⃣ **Process & Upload an Image from HTTP Request**
```go
func uploadHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    file, header, err := r.FormFile("file")
    if err != nil {
        http.Error(w, "Failed to get file", http.StatusInternalServerError)
        return
    }
    defer file.Close()

    url, err := processor.ProcessImage(file, header, 80)
    if err != nil {
        http.Error(w, "Failed to process image", http.StatusInternalServerError)
        return
    }

    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Image uploaded to: %s", url)
}
```
